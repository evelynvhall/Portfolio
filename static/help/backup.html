<h1>Backing Up Your Data</h1>
<hr>
<p>As with all software,  it is important to keep IMPS backed up 
regularly.</p>
<h3>Backing up photos</h3>
<p>IMPS can create an archive of all the image files in the item
   image directory. When you installed or configured IMPS, you set
   the path to the image storage directory. All image files in this 
   directory can be archived and downloaded from the control panel.
<p><b>To back up your item photos:</b></p>
<ol>
<li>From the IMPS home page, click the Control panel (CP) icon<br>
    (<img src="/static/help/icons/cp.png" height="30px;">).</li>
<li>Select the <i>Backups</i> tab in the control panel.</li>
<li>Click the <i>Archive photos</i> button.</li>
<li>Once the archive is created, IMPS will show the download
    page. You can click the <i>Download</i> button 
    <img src="/static/help/icons/download_icon.png" height="30px;">
    to download the archive onto your local computer.</li>
    <p class="note"><b>Note:</b> The archive contains all the image
    files you have stored on IMPS. While only the most recent
    archive can be downloaded from the IMPS control panel, 
    IMPS does not delete archive files from the disk. You can 
    find all your old archive files in the directory shown in 
    the <b>Backup directory</b> field on <i>Server info</i>
    tab on the Control panel.</p>

</ol>
<h3>Backing up the database</h3>
<p>IMPS has a built-in ability to create a backup of the database. To
   start a database backup:
<ol>
<li>From the IMPS home page, click the Control Panel (CP) icon <br>
     (<img src="/static/help/icons/cp.png" height="30px;">)</li>
<li>Click <b>Backup now</b> to create a backup.</li>
<li>Once the data backup file has been created, IMPS will show
the download page. You can click the <i>Download</i> button 
    <img src="/static/help/icons/download_icon.png" height="30px;">
    to download the backup file to your local computer.</li>
    <p class="note"><b>Note:</b> The backup contains all the necessary 
    SQL to re-create your database. While only the most recent backup 
    can be downloaded from the IMPS control panel, IMPS does not delete 
    backup files from the disk. You can find all your old backups 
    in the directory shown in the <b>Backup directory</b> field on 
   <i>Server info</i> tab on the Control panel.</p>
</ol>
