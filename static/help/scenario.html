<h1>An IMPS scenario</h1>
<hr>
<p>Lets say you have three boxes of items you are
storing. Two of these boxes are in your basement 
and contain household decorations, and the other is
in your garage and contains office supplies. This 
scenario will walk you through putting these items
and boxes into IMPS.</p>
<p>For this example, we will assume you are adding
   the items from one of the two boxes in the basement 
   to IMPS first.</p>
<p><b>Add a box</b></p>
<p>Before you can add items, you must have a box to 
put them in. </p>
<ol>
<li>From the IMPS home page, click the <i>Add box</i> 
    icon to open the <i>Add box</i> page.</li>
<li>Here under <i>Box number</i> the <i>First available
    unused box number</i> will be selected and the number
    <b>1</b> will be in the field.</li>
<li>Since the first box you are adding is in the basement,
    in the <i>location</i> field you would type
    &quot;Basement&quot;. This will create a new 
    location named &quot;Basement&quot; for use when 
    we add future boxes in this location.</li>
<li>You may optionally assign a box name.</li>
<li>Once you are done, click <i>Add box</i> to add the
    box to IMPS.</li></ol>
<p><b>Add items</b></p>
<p>Once the box is added, you will be taken to the
   confirmation page. To begin adding items:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click the <i>Add items</i> button.
<li>The <i>Add a new item</i> page will open.</li>
<li>Give the item a name. Every item must have a
    name assigned. For this example, we will say that
    the first item is a decorative vase, so enter
    &quot;vase&quot; as the name.
<li>Choose a box. Since we are working with box 1,
    put the number 1 in the <i>Box number</i> field.</li>
<li>Select a category. By default, this field will be
    set to &quot;Uncategorized&quot;. Because this
    item is a decorative vase, type &quot;Decorating&quot;
    in the field. This will create a new category named
    &quot;Decorating&quot; for use when we add future 
    items.</li>
<li>You can also add a description. For our example, 
    enter &quot;Glass vase with etched roses&quot; in
    the <i>Description</i> field.</li>
<li>Add a photo. By default, <i>No photo</i> is selected
    in the photo section. To add a photo:
    <ol><li>Click the <i>Browse</i> button</li>
    <li>Take a photo or choose one from your photo 
    library</li>
    <li>Click <i>Open</i> to queue the file to be uploaded.</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="note">IMPS only allows JPG, PNG, and HEIC photos</p>
</li>
<li>Once you are done, click <i>Add</i> to add the
    item to IMPS.</i>
<li>Once the item is added, you will be taken to the 
   item details page. Here you can review your entry
   to ensure it is correct.</li>
</ol>
<p>Continue adding items until the box is full.</p>
<p><b>Print the label</b></p>
<p>One important feature of IMPS is the QR code-enabled
   box labels. The next step in using IMPS is to label
   the box you have just filled.</p>
<p>To print the label:</p>
<ol>
<li>From the IMPS home page, click the <i>Box list</i>
    icon.
<li>On the Box list page, click the QR code button
    in the <i>label</i> column of the row containing
    box one.
<li>When the new window opens, click <i>Print</i>
<li>Once printing has finished, click <i>Close</i>
<li>Attach the label to your box.
</ol>
<p><b>Add the second box</b></p>
<p>Next, repeat the above steps for a second box from
   the basement. When you add the box, IMPS will 
   automatically choose 2 as its number. You will notice
   that in the <i>locations</i> field, one of the 
   pre-filled options is &quot;Basement&quot;.</b>
<p>Now add items to this box--naming, categorizing, and 
   photographing them as above--setting their 
   box number to <b>2</b> this time--until you have added
   all items from the second box to IMPS. Then print 
   the second label and attach it to the second box</p>
<p><b>Add the third box</b></p>
<p>The third box is the one from the garage that contains
   office items. When you add the third box, type
   &quot;Garage&quot; in the <i>location</i> field before 
   clicking the <i>Add</i> button.</p>
<p>Again following the above steps, add items--naming, 
   and photographing them--but this time
   setting their cateogry to &quot;Office&quot; and setting 
   their box number to <b>3</b>--until you have 
   added all items from the second box to IMPS. Then print
   the label and attach it to the third box</p>
<p><b>Finding items</b></p>
<p>Now suppose some time has passed and you need the
   vase we added to one of the above boxes but you don't
   remember which box it is in. There are several ways
   to find it using IMPS.</p>
<p>You can:</p>
<ul><li>Search for the item. IMPS has the item and its
   description, so from the IMPS home page, a search
   for &quot;vase&quot; or &quot;glass&quot; or 
   &quot;rose&quot; will return the vase as one of the
   results, since all of those terms are used in the
   name and description.</li>
<li>View the inventory. The inventory is a sortable
    list of all items in IMPS. Since the glass vase
    went in first, selecting the inventory and then
    sorting by date would bring the vase to the top
    of the inventory list.</li>
<li>View items by category. Perhaps you are looking 
    for an item to decorate your table not the vase 
    specifically. You could choose the <i>By cateogry</i>
    view to see all the decorative items you have
    in IMPS.</li>
<li>View the box contents. Perhaps you think you 
    remember that the vase you're looking for was 
    in box 1, but you're not sure. You could choose
    the <i>By box</i> view and look at all the items
    that are in box 1.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Seeing box contents from the label</b></p>
<p>One of the more useful features of IMPS is the
   QR code-enabled box labels. Imagine that you are in
   your basement and you want to know what is in box 2.
   You can point your smart phone or tablet's camera
   at the box label, and you will be taken to the
   <i>By box</i> page for that box, which will show
   you a complete list of all the items you have
   added to IMPS with their box number set to <b>2</b>.
