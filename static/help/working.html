<h1>Working with IMPS</h1>
<hr>
<p>IMPS is designed to help you keep track of things that you own 
   that are in storage. It is based on the idea of 
   &quot;<a href="items.html">items</a>&quot;--things that you 
   are storing, &quot;<a href="boxes.html">boxes</a>&quot;--containers 
   that you are keeping the items in, and (optionally) 
   &quot;<a href="categories.html">categories</a>&quot;--into which 
   items are grouped for easier finding/sorting and 
   &quot;<a href="locations.html">locations</a>&quot;--places where the 
   boxes are stored.</p>
<h2>The interface</h2>
<p><b>The Home Page</b></p>
<p>You can use the IMPS web interface to interact with items and boxes.
   The IMPS home page provides links to the tools and views needed 
   to manage your items and boxes. Here you can search for an item,
   view a complete list of all items, view items in a particular
   category, and more.</p>
<b>QR Codes</b>
<p>For each box, IMPS creates a label that contains a QR code that
   points to the IMPS page for that box. If you print out these labels
   and attach them to the boxes, you can point your phone at the QR 
   code and IMPS will show you a list of items in that box. This means
   you don't have to read the box name or number and enter it in to
   IMPS (though you can), which simplifies and speeds up the process
   of seeing the contents of a box.</p>
<p>From any box page (box contents, box edit, box list) you can click
   the QR code icon <img src="icons/qr_icon.png" height="30px"> to
   open the box label.
<p><b>IMPS Views</b></p>
<p>IMPs is designed to be used on either a desktop computer or a mobile
   device. On many IMPS pages, you will see a view switch at the top.
   Clicking the non-highlighted view will switch to the other view. If
   you are viewing the contents of a box in the desktop view
    <img src="icons/desktop_set_icon.png" height="30px">, click the
   mobile icon <img src="icons/mobile_icon.png" height="30px"> and IMPS 
   will show you the box contents in the mobile view. IMPS will 
   remember which view you were using last and show that view across 
   the program.</p>
<p>The mobile view is a tiled view of all the image items for the
   page you are viewing. The desktop view is a tablular list with
   sortable columns.</p>
<p><b>Customizing views</b></p>
<p>You can change how the views look, including which columns are displayed 
   and how many photos are shown per row in the Views page of the control
   panel. To customize your view, from the home page click the control panel
   icon (CP) and then click the Views button.</p>
