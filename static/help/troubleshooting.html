<h1>Troubleshooting IMPS</h1>
<hr>
<h2>Installation issues</h2>
<p><b>Pip issues</b><p>
<p>If you attempt to install IMPS using the
directions provided and you encounter dependency
errors running <code>pip install -r requirements.txt</code>
you can attempt to resolve these by installing the 
libraries individually. For example, if the above
command fails with a version error for the bcrypt
library, you can try <code>pip install bcrypt</code>
to install it.</p>
<p><b>Database issues</b></p>
<p>When IMPS is first installed, it will open a welcome
page that will show you the status of various settings.
If the database setting section has red indicators, or 
pages consistently return database errors, it's likely
you database connection is misconfigured. To manually
check your database, start your db server's interactive
envornment (<code>mysql -u root</code>) and verify that
your server is running and reachable. Then, attempt to login 
using the credentials you set in <i>imps_cofig.toml</i> 
(<code> mysql -u &lt;user&gt; -p &lt;password&gt;)</p>
<p>Included with IMPS in the <i>static/backups</i>
directory is a <i>setup.sql</i> file that will create
the necessary db structure. Check that this structure
exists.</p>
<p><b>Directory issues</b></p>
<p>If you encounter problems with IMPS related to reading
or writing files, check that the correct directories
are set in <i>imps_cofig.toml</i> and that they are
read/writable by whichever user account is running IMPS.</p>
<p><b>Password problems</b></p>
<p>If you cannot access IMPS because of problems with your
password, view what it is set to in <i>imps_cofig.toml</i>
and verify that you are using the same password to log in.</p>
