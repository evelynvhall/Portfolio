<h1>Notes on setting up the database</h1>
<hr>
<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
<p>You must have MySQl or Mariadb running to use IMPS.
Once you have a working installation of your database server, 
you will need a database for IMPS to use and a user/password 
combination for a user that has permissions to that db.</p>
<p>The setup.sql file included with IMPS contains the necessary
commands to create and structure the IMPS database and to 
create a user with the necessary permissions. While the file
has a default username and password provided, you should
edit the file to change these to something unique to your
IMPS install for security purposes.</p>
<p>The line to edit is:</p>
<p><code>CREATE USER IF NOT EXISTS 'box_user'@'localhost' 
IDENTIFIED BY 'box_pass';</code></p>
<p>Change <code>box_user</code> and <code>box_pass</code></p>

<li><code>sudo mysql -u root</code></li>
<li><code>mysql> source static/backups/setup.sql</code></li>
<li><code>quit;</code></li>
</ol>
