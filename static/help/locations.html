<h1>Using locations</h1>
<hr>
<h2>About locations</h2>
<p>IMPS locations are arbitrary groups that you can
   assign to boxes which provide an additional tool to
   further organize, sort, and find them. By default, new 
   boxes are assigned to the &quot;Unspecified&quot; location.</p>
<p class="note">Locations apply to boxes, not items. The 
   &quot;By loc&quot; button on the home page shows a list of
   boxes.</p>
<p>Assigning a locations is optional. When you add or edit an 
   box, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Choose not to select a location, which means the box 
    location will set to &quot;Unspecified&quot;</li>
<li>Select an existing location to assign the box to</li>
<li>Type a new location name for this box. The new location
    will be used for this box and will be added to the list
    of locations in the location selection field when you
    use it in the future.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Managing locations</h2>
<p>The easiest way to work with locations is to select or add
   them when adding boxs. However, you can add, edit, or delete
   locations using the control panel.</p>
<p><b>Adding a location</b></p>
<p>If you add a new location using the control panel, it will 
   be added to the list of locations in the location selection 
   field when you use it in the future.</p>
<p><b>Editing a location</b></p>
<p>If you edit a location, all boxs assigned to that location
   will have their location set with the changes location name.
   For instance, if you have a location called &quot;Cellar&quot;
   and you edit its name to be &quot;Basement&quot;, all boxs that
   previously were assigned to the &quot;Cellar&quot; location
   will now be assigned to the &quot;Basement&quot; location.</p>
<p><b>Deleting a location</b></p>
<p>If you delete a location, all boxs assigned to that location  
   will have their location set to &quot;Uncategorized.&quot;</p>
