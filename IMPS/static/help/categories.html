<h1>Using Categories</h1>
<hr>
<h2>About categories</h2>
<p>IMPS categories are arbitrary groups that you can
   assign to items which provide an additional tool to
   further organize, sort, and find them. By default, new items
   are assigned to the &quot;Uncategorized&quot; category.</p>
<p>Assigning a category is optional. When you add or edit an 
   item, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Choose not to select a category, which means the item 
   will saved as &quot;Uncategorized&quot;</li>
<li>Select an existing category to assign the item to</li>
<li>Type a new category name for this item. The new category
    will be used for this item and will be added to the list
    of categories in the category selection field when you
    use it in the future.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Managing categories</h2>
<p>The easiest way to work with categories is to select or add
   them when adding items. However, you can add, edit, or delete
   categories using the control panel.</p>
<p><b>Adding a category</b></p>
<p>If you add a new category using the control panel, it will 
   be added to the list of categories in the category selection 
   field when you use it in the future.</p>
<p><b>Editing a category</b></p>
<p>If you edit a category, all items assigned to that category
   will have their category set with the changes category name.
   For instance, if you have a category called &quot;decorating&quot;
   and you edit its name to be &quot;decorate&quot;, all items that
   previously were assigned to the &quot;decorating&quot; category
   will now be assigned to the &quot;decorate&quot; category.</p>
<p><b>Deleting a category</b></p>
<p>If you delete a category, all items assigned to that category  
   will have their category set to &quot;Uncategorized.</p>
