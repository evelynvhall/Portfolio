<h1>Using QR code labels</h1>
<hr>
<h2>About QR codes</h2>
<p>When you create and print a box label, the label
will contain a QR code image that will be a link to the 
IMPS box contents page for that box. This QR code
is generated by IMPS based on your IMPS server's IP
address. This means that your IMPS server must have a static
IP address in order for the label QR code to work correctly.</p>
<p>In addition, if you use Flask to test IMPS, the QR code
will point to the IP address of the server, plus to port
on which Flask is serving the pages. </p>
<p>For example, if your home server's IP address is
192.168.0.1 and you start IMPS with Flask's default
settings, IMPS will be served at 192.168.0.1:88 and
the QR code on your labels will also point to that
IP address an port. If you later move to using a WSGI
server that serves IMPS on port 80 (the standard HTTP 
port) the labels will no lponger work, because they 
will be pointing to the old port.</p>
