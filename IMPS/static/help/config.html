<h1>Configuring IMPS</h1>
<hr>
<p>Configure database settings and IMPS directories in the imps_config.toml file 
located in the root of your IMPS install.</p>
<h2>imps_config.toml</h2>
<pre>
## DATABASE CONNECTION
[DEFAULT]
host = 127.0.0.1 
database = box_db
user = box_user 
password = box_pass

## DIRECTORIES
item_image_dir = /static/images/items/
backup_dir = /var/www/html/static/backups 
help_dir = /var/www/html/static/help/
</pre>
<h2>The Control Panel</h2>
<p>The IMPS control panel allows you to see various
IMPS settings and to perform some management tasks that
don't otherwise fit into the overall IMPS interface.</p>
<p>The control panel contains four tabs:</p>
<h3>Boxes Items</h3>
<b>Categories</b>
<p> You can add, delete, and modify categories using the 
<i>Categories</i> button. If you rename a category, all items
assigned to that category will be assigned to the renamed
category. If you delete a category, items assigned to that
category will still be assigned to it, but the category
name won't appear in the list of categories.</p>
<b>Locations</b>
<p> You can add, delete, and modify locations using the
<i>locations</i> link. If you rename a location, all boxes
assigned to that location will be assigned to the renamed
location. If you delete a location, items assigned to that
location will be assigned to the <i>Unspecified</i> location</p>
<h3>Backups</h3>
<p>IMPS can backup your items (the tables from the database)
and the photos associated with them. The <i>Backup</i> tab
provides buttons to create these backups and to download the
latest backup. Imps does not delete old versions of these backups.
<h3>Cleanup</h3>
<b>Show orphaned items</b>
<p>When you delete a box, you can delete all the items in
the box from the database, reassign all the items to a new
box, or &quot;orphan&quot; the items, which means they have no box
assigned to them. While these items will still show in the
search, inventory, and category views, this tool provides an
easy way to see all these items in one place.Clicking the 
<i>Show orphaned items</i> button will show a list of all 
items which are not assigned to a box.</p>
<b>Show unlinked photos</b>
<p>IMPS is designed to remove item photos when items are deleted
or to delete the old item photo when a new one is uploaded.
However, the control panel contains a tool to check for photos
that are not linked to an item and delete them. While rare, this 
can sometimes occur if there is a database connection problem 
when editing or deleting an item.</p>
<h3>Server Info</h3>
<p>This tab shows a read-only view of the IMPS configuration from
the imps_config.toml file.</p>
