<h1>Managing Boxes</h1>
<hr>
<p>IMPS uses the concept of boxes as containers for <a href="items.html">items</a>. You must create a 
   box before adding an item. Each box is assigned a number. IMPS will suggest the next available 
   number sequentially or allow you to choose an unused number. Boxes may also be assigned a name 
   and location, both of which are optional.</p>
<h2>Adding a box</h2>
<ol>
<li>From the home page, select <b>Add box</b> to begin adding a new box.</li>
<li>IMPS will show the number of the first unused box (sequentially).
    <ul>
       <li>You may use this box number by selecting <b>First available unused box number.</b></li>
       <li>You may choose a different box number by selecting <b>Choose number</b> and entering a
           number. Box numbers must be positive integers.</l>
    </ul>
<li>Enter a <b>Location</b>. You may select a location from the dropdown, type a new location name,
    or choose not to enter a location. If you do not choose a location, the box location will be
    automatically set to <i>Unspecified</i>.</li>
<li>Enter a <b>Box name</b>. Box names are optional, but are printed on box labels and can help
    when searching for items.</li>
<li>Click <b>Add box</b> when done to add the box to the database.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Viewing Boxes</h2>
<ol>
<li>From the home page, select <b>Box list</b> to show the list of all boxes or
    <b>By loc</b> to select a location to show a list of boxes in a specific
    location.</li>

    in the IMPS database. On this page you can:

    the changes. If you do remove the current location, the box location will be 
    automatically set to <i>Unspecified</i>.</li>
<li>Enter a <b>Box name</b>. Box names are optional, but are printed on box labels and can help
    when searching for items.</li>

       <li>Delete the box and move all items to another box</li>
       <li>Delete the box and delete all items assigned to the box</li>
   </ol>

a new box that the items should be assigned to.</li>
